    "## Basics of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini are neural networks trained on trillions of tokens so they learn statistical patterns of language and reasoning. They operate token-by-token: given previous tokens plus the prompt, the model predicts probabilities for the next token, samples one, then repeats until a stop condition or max length. The art of using LLMs therefore revolves around understanding tokens and the knobs that shape each sampling step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokens and context windows\n",
    "- **Tokens** are the smallest text chunks the model sees (roughly a word or part of a word). Pricing, latency, and limits are all measured in tokens.\n",
    "- **Context windows** cap how many tokens the model can process at once (e.g., 128k tokens). Both input and output tokens count toward this limit.\n",
    "- **Counting tokens** up front avoids truncation: mind the `max_output_tokens` you request versus the remaining room in the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters you can tune in API calls\n",
    "| Parameter | What it controls | When to raise | When to lower | Example |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| `temperature` | Scales randomness during sampling. 0 = deterministic, 1 = creative. | Brainstorming, dialogue, creative writing. | Instructions, coding, summarization. | `temperature=0.2` for precise Q&A, `temperature=0.8` for ideation. |\n",
    "| `top_p` (nucleus sampling) | Keeps only the smallest set of tokens whose probabilities sum to `p`. | When you want open-ended but coherent text. | When you need strict determinism. | `top_p=0.9` keeps ~90% cumulative probability mass. |\n",
    "| `top_k` | Restricts sampling to the top-k most likely tokens. | When platform exposes it (Anthropic, Google, some OpenAI betas) and you want controlled diversity. | When chasing single best answer. | `top_k=40` only considers the 40 most probable tokens. |\n",
    "| `max_output_tokens` | Hard cap on generated length. | Prevent verbose responses, control spend. | Need longer explanations or documents. | `max_output_tokens=256` for summaries, `1024` for reports. |\n",
    "| `presence_penalty` | Penalizes using tokens already present in the prompt/output, nudging new topics. | Encourage model to explore new ideas. | Preserve topic repetition (e.g., keyword stuffing). | `presence_penalty=0.3` to avoid repeating the same sentence. |\n",
    "| `frequency_penalty` | Penalizes repeating the same token multiple times. | Remove loops and redundant wording. | Preserve repetition (poetry, chants). | `frequency_penalty=0.5` to keep lists concise. |\n",
    "| `stop` / `stop_sequences` | Strings that halt generation when hit. | Force the model to hand control back to you. | Rarely. Use only if you truly need to cut output. | `stop=[\"Observation:\"]` in ReAct workflows. |\n",
    "| `logprobs` / `logit_bias` | Inspect or alter token probabilities. | Debugging, constraining to specific outputs. | Most production flows. | `logit_bias={\"</s>\": -100}` to block EOS. |\n",
    "| `response_format` / `json_schema` | Forces strict JSON or structured replies when supported. | Building agents and tools that parse responses. | Free-form prose. | `response_format={\"type\":\"json_schema\",\"json_schema\":...}`. |\n",
    "| `seed` | Makes sampling reproducible when supported. | Testing, demos. | Production (unless determinism desired). | `seed=123` for consistent completions. |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule of thumb:** `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` all affect randomness—tweak only one or two at a time to understand the change. Penalties reshape style, while max tokens, stop signals, and response formats control structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example API call with tuned parameters\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from openai import OpenAI\n",

    "- Raise `max_output_tokens` whenever the answer needs room (e.g., multi-section reports).\n",

      "     - Sterile gloves\n",
      "     - Antiseptic solution (e.g., Chlorhexidine or Betadine)\n",
      "     - Sterile syringes and saline\n",
      "     - Gauze pads\n",
      "     - Biohazard waste bags\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Clean Workspace:**\n",
      "     - Disinfect the surface where the setup will occur.\n",
      "     - Ensure that the area is free of non-sterile items.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Hand Hygiene**\n",
      "   - Perform hand hygiene using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n",
      "   - Put on a pair of sterile gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Drape Setup**\n",
      "   - Open sterile drapes and arrange them in a manner to cover the procedure area without contaminating them.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **Equipment Assembly**\n",
      "   - Open the ICP monitoring kit maintaining sterility.\n",
      "   - Remove sterile components from their packaging without touching non-sterile surfaces.\n",
      "   - Connect the catheter or probe to the monitoring system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. **Prepare the Site**\n",
      "   - Cleanse the insertion site on the patient's scalp using the antiseptic solution, applying it in a circular motion from the center outwards.\n",
      "   - Allow the area to dry completely to ensure maximum efficacy of the antiseptic.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 6. **Insert ICP Monitor**\n",
      "   - Using a sterile technique, insert the ICP catheter into the prepared site, adhering to the protocol specific to the monitoring system being used.\n",
      "   - Ensure that the catheter is placed correctly and secured as per standard guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7. **Connect Monitoring System**\n",
      "   - Connect the monitoring system to the catheter ensuring that all connections are secure.\n",
      "   - Ensure there are no air bubbles in the tubing and that the system is primed with sterile saline as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 8. **Calibrate and Test**\n",
      "   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibrating the ICP monitor.\n",
      "   - Test the system to ensure proper function before proceeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 9. **Documentation**\n",
      "   - Document the procedure including the date, time, site of insertion, patient’s response, and any other relevant information.\n",
      "   - Ensure that all sterile supplies used are accounted for.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 10. **Post-Procedure Care**\n",
      "   - Monitor the insertion site for signs of infection or complications.\n",
      "   - Dispose of all used materials in biohazard waste bags.\n",
      "   - Perform hand hygiene after completing the procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Notes\n",
      "- Always follow institutional protocols and guidelines when performing invasive procedures.\n",
      "- The personnel conducting the setup should be trained and credentialed to perform ICP monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Training and Review\n",
