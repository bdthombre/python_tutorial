      "A team at Delray Medical Center in Florida became the first hospital in the Southeastern United States to complete a spine surgery using Medivis’ augmented reality (AR) spine-navigation system. Performed by Dr. Lloyd Zucker, Chief of Neurosurgery, the procedure leveraged AR-projected, patient-specific 3D holograms directly onto the surgical field, enabling rapid, submillimetric placement of spinal hardware. Hospital leadership noted this integration of spatial targeting, AI-driven segmentation, and 3D renderings significantly enhances surgical precision, reduces operating time, and ultimately improves patient outcomes.

      "Similarly, in September 2025, Ascension St. Vincent’s Riverside in Jacksonville adopted laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for minimally invasive treatment of brain tumors and epilepsy. Neurosurgeon Dr. Aristotelis Filippidis uses a fiber-optic laser catheter through a small skull opening to thermally ablate diseased tissue while sparing surrounding healthy brain. Patients benefit from smaller incisions, less postoperative pain, and accelerated recovery compared to traditional craniotomy.
